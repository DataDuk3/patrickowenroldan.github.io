When I was a kid, my mom baught me a box full of lego pieces. I remember playing with it more often than I remember. The process of creating something and bringing it to life with just my own imagination is something I loved doing when I was little.

Creating electronic devices, robots, controllers are what I considered "lego pieces" and programming software/firmware are my imagination bringing life to those pieces, only this time its real.
